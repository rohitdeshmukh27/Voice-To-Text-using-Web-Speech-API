# Voice-to-Text Demo (Browser Only)

A simple voice-to-text app that runs entirely in the browser using the native **Web Speech API** — no API keys, servers, or external libraries required.

---

## 🚀 What I Used
- **Web Speech API** – browser-built-in voice-to-text functionality  
- `SpeechRecognition` (`webkitSpeechRecognition` for Chrome/Safari)  
- No external libraries or services

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Uses your browser’s native speech-recognition engine  
2. Works offline in most modern browsers  
3. Converts speech to text in real-time  
4. Supports English language recognition
